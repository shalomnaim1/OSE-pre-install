# JenkinsPOC

In this project, we dockerize integration test for Jenkins builds.
We create a DockerFile to build a docker image of integration test, this image will create a Fedora environment with all the dependencies that required to run tests.

## Image creation steps:
1. Clone base Image (Fedora image)
1. Export the relevant environment variables
1. Install all the dependencies
1. Placing configuration files
1. decrypt of the credential (during the container initiation)
1. Rendering the environment file (during the container initiation)

## Required environment variables:
* WHARF_IP: IP address of a selenium server, we decided to work with Whorf
* WHARF_PORT: Port of a selenium container
* CONF_PATH: Path of integration test config files
* YAYCL_CRYPT_KEY: Key for credentials decryption
* STREAM: Stream version for CFME

## Author spacial parameters
If a result file (XUnit or JUnit) is required you may have to share a host filesystem with the container.
This can be done using `-v` option while you starting the container, and setting pytest to save the results on this path.

## How to create and run an Image
To create a image just run the following command:
```{bash}
docker build -t <image_name>:<image tag> -f <doker_file_page> .
```

When the image file is ready, you can run the tests inside the container,

In the following example, I will show how to start running CMQE test using a container and save the results to local dir (/tmp/results) on the host.
The container will start in detach mode (run in the background)

```{bash}
docker run -d
           -v /tmp/results:/tmp --privileged
           --env WHARF_IP=5.6.7.8
           --env WHARF_PORT=80
           --env CONF_PATH=/integration_tests/conf
           --env YAYCL_CRYPT_KEY=<decipher key>
           --env SPROUT_URL=<sprout_url>
           --env STREAM=<stream>
           bin/sh -c "sh setup.sh
                    cd integrations_tests
                    pytest /integration_test/cfme/tests/containers/test_basic_metrics.py --use-provider cm-env2 --junitxml /tmp/my_xunit.xml"
